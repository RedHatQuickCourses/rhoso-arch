== Introduction

This chapter introduces the OpenShift and Kubernetes concepts required to manage networking and storage connectivity for application workloads and how Red Ha OpenStack Services on OpenShift uses these concepts to connect OpenStack control planes to networking and storage resources required by its compute nodes.

OpenShift and Kubernetes concepts are explaind in a top-down fashion, starting with standard Kubernetes networking and storage, them presenting additional features from OpenShift add-on operators.
