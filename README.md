# Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift Architecture Quick Course

This is the first course of the Red Hat OpenStack Administration learning journey. It assumes you're already skilled as an OpenStack Operator.

The course design docs are available to Red Hat employees only:

* [Initial course design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VHPTKWEnBc1McG6_dJR7645ozNQvnAt_AcVpb9JYvMs/edit#)
* [OpenStack 18 Learning Journey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zlyj21ZOp0wtMPqdS3P9auhDndaQ6_qs014q_0yPbo4/edit#slide=id.g29c770ffa7c_0_414)

Figures on this course were designed using Google Slides, and are also avialble  to Red Hat employees only. Individual slides are exported to PNG files and those files are in the git repository.

* Diagrams from all chapters are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FyaMiLGAP3sBdJNbwy1JExXbUYGcV83LZGJnKJQO34A/edit#).

Reading time estimation was done by running the reading-time.sh script on individual adoc files prior to commiting them, for example:

$ bash ./reading-time.sh modules/ch1-architecture/pages/s3-tasks-lecture.adoc
