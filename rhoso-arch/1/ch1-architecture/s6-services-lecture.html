<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up to this point, we presented OpenStack services such as Nova and Neutron as black boxes. We gave you hints that each of these services might have a more complex internal structure, because they have pieces running on the OpenStack control plane and pieces running on OpenStack compute nodes, and they also need support from other services such as database and messaging servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you inspect the Kubernetes API resources which represent those OpenStack services, for example to troubleshoot performance and availability issues of those services, you must understand how their internal components relate to each other and to other OpenStack services.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_an_example_openstack_nova"><a class="anchor" href="#_an_example_openstack_nova"></a>An Example: OpenStack Nova</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s use OpenStack Nova as an example, not only because it is the most important, but because it also includes some complexity you may not see if we pick one of the simpler OpenStack services.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/s6-services-lecture-fig-1.png" alt="s6 services lecture fig 1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The figure shows the external and internal views of the architecture of OpenStack Nova. From the external view, Nova interacts with other OpenStack services: Cinder, Glance, Neutron, and Placement. That besides Keystone, which every OpenStack service has to interact with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These interactions happen using HTTP, in fact they use the same OpenStack APIs that the OpenStack client and Horizon use to communicate with these OpenStack services. For our purposes, it doesn&#8217;t matter which of the internal components of Nova communicate with which OpenStack services: they all exist inside the black box of Nova.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the internal view, opening the black box, all components of Nova communicate with each other using AMQP message-passing, including components which run outside of OpenShift, on RHEL compute nodes. Components running on the OpenStack control plane can also communicate with a relational database server to store data from API resource instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following are the main components of OpenStack Nova. The OpenStack community documentation call them "Nova services" and you will see that "services" is a very overloaded term in both OpenStack and OpenShift, so be sure that you know to which kind of service you refer to, at any moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Nova API</dt>
<dd>
<p>Provides the API entry point for all OpenStack clients, services, and users which need to use services from Nova. No component external to Nova communicates with any component except the API entry point.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Nova Scheduler</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selects a compute node to run new server instances, taking into account the availability of compute capacity, storage, and network connectivity.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Nova Conductor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mediates communication between Compute components running on individual compute nodes and the relational database server, which could easily become overloaded with too many connections from too many compute nodes.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Nova Compute</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unlike other components, which run on an OpenStack control plane, that is, as containers on OpenShift, the Compute component runs on RHEL compute nodes. It is the component which interacts with the local KVM hypervisor to connect virtual machines and attach them to virtual network and storage resources.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenStack Nova may include other components not shown in the figure, and Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift runs a few of them. For example, there&#8217;s a component which mediates remote console sessions using the VNC protocol. We ommit these components for simplicity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_internal_scalability_of_openstack_services"><a class="anchor" href="#_internal_scalability_of_openstack_services"></a>Internal Scalability of OpenStack Services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The previous figure shows a single icon for each internal component of OpenStack Nova but there could be multiple instances of each component, which could run on different control plane servers. That is, there could be multiple containers on OpenShift for each of the components of Nova, potentialy running on different nodes of an OpenShift cluster. This enables Nova to handle a large number of compute nodes running an even larger number of virtual machines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fact that each component of Nova can be scaled to multiple containers independently of other components enables OpenStack Administrators to efficiently handle different scenarios, for example: is the bottleneck caused by too many messages from too many Nova Compute instances, each on a compute nodes? Run more Nova Conductor instances! Is the bottleneck caused by a CI/CD system which provisions and tears down too many server instances in a short period of time? Scale the Nova API instances! Is the bottleneck caused by complex attributes of compute nodes, host aggregates, and a large number of server flavors? Scale the Nova Scheduler instances!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_other_openstack_user_facing_services"><a class="anchor" href="#_other_openstack_user_facing_services"></a>Other OpenStack User-Facing Services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other OpenStack services are expected to follow a similar architecture to Nova. They don&#8217;t have to, but by convention and by design best practices from the OpenStack community you expect that they do and, unless you are a developer working on the internal implementation of OpenStack services themselves, you do not need to care about eventual inconsistencies bentween different OpenStack services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So you expect that no service interacts with each other except by using their public APIs over HTTP. You also expect that internal components of any service interact with each other using AMQP messaging passing and all store API resources on a relational database. Finally, you expect that all OpenStack services could run multiple containers for scalability and high availability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some OpenStack services may run entirely on the control plane, for example Swift, Glance, and Heat. A few services require a component running on compute nodes, for example Neutron and Cinder. Components running on compute nodes communicate with components running on the control plane by using AMQP message passing. If these componentes also need to interact with other OpenStack Services, they use HTTP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The services-oriented architecture of OpenStack does not forces all its services into the same mold. Each service can make different architectural and implementation decisions, if they need to. This leads to occasional inconsistencies, but it is a small price to pay for increased flexibility and scalability.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_internal_services_of_openstack_clusters"><a class="anchor" href="#_internal_services_of_openstack_clusters"></a>Internal Services of OpenStack Clusters</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some internal services of a Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift cluster are shared by multiple OpenStack user-facing server. User-facing services do not need to share internal-infrastructure services, but it is simpler to manage fewer instances of each service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, you could have different database servers for each OpenStack service, but there is no reason to not share the same database server for all of them, at least until the database itself becomes overload with too many queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a similar vein, you could have Nova instances have their own RabbitMQ services for its cells, independent of RabbitMQ services for Neutron and Cinder cells, but you usually configure the same cells and use the same RabbitMQ cells for all services. The fact that you could do it differently does not mean you should do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other OpenStack services may require specialized internal services to fulfill their funcionality, for example: we already mentioned that Nova needs remote desktop protocol servers to enable access to server instance consoles. Neutron needs a software-defined networking layer. And a few OpenStack services need clients for networked file or block storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_openstack_compute_cell_services"><a class="anchor" href="#_openstack_compute_cell_services"></a>OpenStack compute cell services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most user-facing OpenStack services included with Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift require a relational database to store API resource instances and an AMQP message passing server. These two internal services define the scope of an OpenStack cluster compute cell and impact the scalability of the entire OpenStack control plane.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Red Hat OpenStack Services includes the following internal infrastructure services to address the needs of relational database and AMQP messaging:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">MariaDB</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is an open source relational database based on the original codebase of MySQL.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Galera</dt>
<dd>
<p>It clusters multiple MySQL and compatible databases in active-active mode with synchronous data replication.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">RabbitMQ</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is an AMQP messaging server which replicates messages between its instances, so no message is lost and message delivery is guaranteed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can deploy proof-of-concept Red Hat OpenShift clusters running a single instance of RabbitMQ and a single instance of MariaDB, without using Galera. For production clusters, Red Hat recommends running multiple instances of each, configured as a database and as a messaging cluster. Good news is that the OpenStack add-on operator handles the clustered, multi-instance deployment of RabbitMQ and MariaDB for an OpenStack compute cell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ovn_networking"><a class="anchor" href="#_ovn_networking"></a>OVN Networking</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another key internal service of Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift is the OVN networking layer, which runs components on both control plane and compute nodes. OVN creates virtual networks by tunneling packets between OpenStack compute nodes and enable strong network isolation between workloads running on OpenStack clusters, whithout the need of external networking gear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OVN distributes network flow databases between compute nodes, in a way that processing those packet flows is distributed among compute nodes, instead of overloading a few network control nodes. OVN handles itself the replication and high availability of these network flow databases, including running multiple instances of the main flow databases at the OpenStack control plane.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OVN is so powerfull that more recent releases of Red Hat OpenShift also use OVN to implement Kubernetes networking and to extend it for more advanced use cases, which wer not originally supported by standard Kubernetes. The OVN instances running on the OpensStack control plane are independent of the OVN instances running on the OpenShift control plane, that is: Kubernetes networking and OpenStack networking are completely independent of each other.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_child_operators_of_the_openstack_add_on_operator"><a class="anchor" href="#_child_operators_of_the_openstack_add_on_operator"></a>Child Operators of the OpenStack Add-On Operator</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have a glimpse of the internal structure of OpenStack services, you realize that each individual service needs its own management, scaling, and configuration. The OpenStack add-on operator handles that by relying on a number of child add-on operators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift includes specialized operators to manage each of the user-facing and internal infrastructure services: There is a Nova operator, a Neutron operator, a RabbitMQ operator, an OVN operator, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift add-on operators have the concept of meta-operator, which is an add-on operator that manages a set of child add-on operators. The OpenStack add-on operator is a meta-operator, and the External Data Plane Management add-on operator, which uses Ansible to manage OpenStack compute nodes, is also a child operator of the OpenStack add-on operator.</p>

<h2 id="_openshift_storage_and_networking_for_openstack_services"><a class="anchor" href="#_openshift_storage_and_networking_for_openstack_services"></a>OpenShift Storage and Networking for OpenStack Services</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The storage and networking services of OpenStack, such as Cinder and Neutron, provide capabilities for workloads running as VMs on OpenStack compute nodes. They do not provide such capabilities for other OpenStack services. OpenStack services, at least their components running on OpenShift, must use networking and storage capabilities from Kubernetes.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_data_storage_requirements_of_openstack_services"><a class="anchor" href="#_data_storage_requirements_of_openstack_services"></a>Data Storage Requirements of OpenStack Services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kubernetes storage requirements from Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift come mainly from internal infrastructure services. User-facing services focus on data storage for compute nodes, which run outside of OpenShift.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only MariaDB, Galera, and RabbitMQ actually store control plane data on disk, so only these three OpenStack services use Kubernetes persistent storage from OpenShift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cinder and Glance run components in RHEL compute nodes which manage connectivity from compute nodes (and their VMs) to storage backends for storing and retrieving data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cinder also runs storage clients on their own containers on OpenShift, to perform storage management, for example creating disk volumes and snapshot. Cinder containers make no use of Kuberentes storage services to manage storage backends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glance also runs storage clients on their own containers on OpenShift to store data from new VM images it receives from OpenStack APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swift may use Kubernetes storage in simple implementations, but most of the time Swift APIs are taken over by external storage, such as Red Hat Ceph Storage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_network_connectivity_requirements_of_openstack_services"><a class="anchor" href="#_network_connectivity_requirements_of_openstack_services"></a>Network Connectivity Requirements of OpenStack Services</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kuberentes networking requirements from Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift come from the necessity of exposing OpenStack APIs to OpenStack Operators and Administators, and from the necessity of exposing those APIs and also exposing AMQP messaging (RabbitMQ) to compute plane nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional requirements come from the common data center design patterns of network isolation, which require that components of OpenStack services running on OpenShift have connectivity to multiple isolated networks, something that standard Kuberntes alone cannot provide.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>All user-facing OpenStack services expose their APIs using standard kubernetes ingress controllers, which are reverse HTTP proxies and also handle load-balancing of multiple API component instances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenStack services invoke APIs of other services using kubernetes internal (cluster) load balancers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each compute cell exposes its AMQP endpoints (from RabbitMQ) using Kubernetes external load-balancer services, which would work only on cloud providers, but OpenShift includes MetalLB which enables load balancer services on physical servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenStack services may expose additional API end points as internal cluster end points for use by compute nodes using Kubernetes external load-balancer services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenStack containers attach to isolated networks using Multus secondary networks from OpenShift. Those connections exist for a variety of reasons, for example to access storage data and storage management networks, or for initiating SSH sessions to compute nodes on behalf of Ansible playbooks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An OpenStack Administrator needs to understand how Kubernetes provides storage and network connectivity for containerized applications and how to expose OpenStack services, both user-facing services and internal infrastructure services, to RHEL compute nodes. In the next chapter we will present the required Kubernetes APIs and concepts.</p>
